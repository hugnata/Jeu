                                              END OF THE PROJECT
                                              
 The game goal wasn't to be a real game and wasn't optimized. So, the game is lagging so much that it become <em>unplayable</em> with
 more than 3 projectiles throwed by the player. I think the project cannot be lead to a playable game. That's why i think we must <em>end this project</em>
